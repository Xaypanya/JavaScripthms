1. What is an algorithm?
-> An algorithm is a set of well-designed instructions to solve particular problem 

2. Why algorithms?
-> As a developer, you're going to across problems that you need to solve 
-> Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems
-> One problem can be solved in many ways
-> Eeach algorithm comes with its own tradeoff
