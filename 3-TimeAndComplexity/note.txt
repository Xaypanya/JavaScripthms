# There are many ways to solve problem
Ex: There are multiple algorithms to sort a list of numbers

# We evaluate the performace of an algorithm in terms of its  input size
1. Time Complexity - amount of Time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of input size
2. Space Complexity - amount of Memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of input size

# How to represent complexity?
-> using Asymntotic notations, it's a mathematical tools
1. Big-O Notation - Worst case complexity (what we must concern)
2. Omega Notation - Best case complexity 
3. Theta Notation - Average case complexity
